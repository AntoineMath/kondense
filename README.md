Kondense is an automated memory sizing tool. It runs as a sidecar in kubernetes pods.

## Background
Kondense uses real-time memory pressure to determine the optimal memory for each containers in a pod.

Allocated memory is not a good proxy for required memory. Many libraries used during startup are loaded into memory only to be never touched again afterwards. 

Kondense uses the memory pressure given by the Linux Kernel to apply just the right amount of memory on a container to page out the unused memory while not getting out-of-memory killed.

## Requirements

### On Kubernetes
1. The Kubernetes cluster must run on Linux.
2. Kubernetes version >= 1.27.
3. Containerd version >= 1.6.9.
4. Kubernetes should have the feature gate `InPlacePodVerticalScaling` enabled.

### On Containers
1. Containers should have the binary `cat`.
2. Containers should include the linux kernel version >= 4.20. Ensure the file `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.pressure` exists in the container to verify it.

## Example

1. Let's say we have a pod running `nginx` that we want to Kondense:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: kondense-test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
```

2. We need to give resources limit to the nginx container so the QoS will be `Guaranteed`. The memory put do not really matter, Kondense will update it on the fly.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: kondense-test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
ðŸ‘‰    resources:
ðŸ‘‰      limits:
ðŸ‘‰        cpu: 0.1
ðŸ‘‰        memory: 100M
```

3. Add a `service account` to the pod with the following rules
```yaml
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "patch"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods/exec"]
    verbs: ["create"]
```

## Requirements
kubernetes >=v1.27
containerd >=v1.6.9

1. Start kind with the feature gate InPlacePodVerticalScaling.
```bash
minikube start --kubernetes-version=v1.29.2 --feature-gates=InPlacePodVerticalScaling=true
```

3. Patch Pod
```bash
kubectl patch pod test-kondense-7fd64b45c5-42nnb --patch '{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"ubuntu", "resources":{"limits":{"memory": "200Mi", "cpu":"100m"},"requests":{"memory": "200Mi", "cpu":"100m"}}}]}}'
```
